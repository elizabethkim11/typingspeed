The garden strawberry is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria, collectively known as the strawberries, which are cultivated worldwide for their fruit.
The strawberry is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness.
The strawberry is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as jam, juice, pies, ice cream, milkshakes, and chocolates.
Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are widely used in products such as candy, soap, lip gloss, perfume, and many others.
The first garden strawberry was grown in Brittany, France, during the late 18th century. Prior to this, wild strawberries and cultivated selections from wild strawberry species were the common source of the fruit.
The strawberry fruit was mentioned in ancient Roman literature in reference to its medicinal use.
People began using the strawberry for its supposed medicinal properties and botanists began naming the different species.
